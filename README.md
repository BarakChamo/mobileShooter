A web-based multiplayer shooter game that went too far!

The base premise is very simple, connect with your phone and use it like a Wii remote to annihilate the competition!

The game is built in ES7 and uses WebSockets to connect the phone controllers in realtime. The graphics are built with Canvas and most of the processing is done in WebWorkers to ensure silky smooth visuals at 60FPS.

We didn't use any libraries or game engines to build this game, everything - from collision detection to rendering and multiplayer networking - is implemented from scratch.
